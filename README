" README SUMMARY" - Seawater Intrusion Model"

Projetc Purpose: 
This project implements a lumped parameter model to simulate and forecast pressure and salinity dynamics in coastal aquifers. This LPM is calibrated with historical data and can be used to evaluate different pumping scenarios for water resource management planning.

Key Features:
1. Solves ODEs numerically with the Backward Euler method
2. Calibrates parameters using curve fitting
3. Generates ensemble predictions via uncertainty quantification
4. Simulates future conditions under 4 pumping scenarios  (increase, decrease, constant, stopped)

How to Run: 
Python version: 3.10 + 
Python " Main V3 (Calibration - Samples).py "
Required packages:  numpy
                    scipy
                    matplotlib

Input Files:
1. " si_pres.txt "  Observed pressure data
2. " si_salt.txt "  Observed salinity data
3. " si_mass.txt "  historical pumping data
4. " forecast_q.csv "  pumping scenarios for future forecasting  

Outputs: 
1. Analytical and Numerical plots for pressure and salinity
2. Calibrated pressure and salinity plots
3. Parameter uncertainty Visualization
4. Four " What-if " pumping rate scenarios plots from 1960 to 2025
